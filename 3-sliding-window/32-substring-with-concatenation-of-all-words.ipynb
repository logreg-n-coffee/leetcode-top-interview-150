    "# Question 32 - 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"]`, then \"`abcdef`\", \"`abefcd`\", \"`cdabef`\", \"`cdefab`\", \"`efabcd`\", and \"`efcdab`\" are all concatenated strings. \"`acdbef`\" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
    "Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s._ You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"]\n",
    "    Output: [0,9]\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 0 is \"barfoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 9 is \"foobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"]\n",
    "    Output: []\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.\n",
    "    There is no substring of length 16 in s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
    "    We return an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"]\n",
    "    Output: [6,9,12]\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 6 is \"foobarthe\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"the\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 9 is \"barthefoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"the\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 12 is \"thefoobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"the\",\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 104`\n",
    "- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`\n",
    "- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`\n",
    "- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n"
